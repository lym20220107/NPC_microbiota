# NPC_microbiota
Oral Streptococcus elevation is associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma

Context:
R.code: R scripts used to reproduce all statistical results and visualized pictures.
Source Data: Including species feature table and subject's metadata.
Processiong Data:
Figure 1. The oral bacterial community is significantly altered in patients with NPC.
Figure 2. Oral microbial disruption in NPC patients is mainly caused by changes in the genus Streptococcus.
Figure 3. Oral streptococcus facilitate screening for NPC, especially in combination with an EBV test.
Figure 4. The oral Streptococcus species enriched in NPC are associated with cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) resistance function.
Figure 5. Oral Streptococcus correlate with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, a biomarker of NPC prognosis.
Extended Data Figure 1. NPC status is the strongest explanatory factor compared with other feature
Extended Data Figure 2. PCoA showing separation of NPC and HC groups upon removal of Streptococcus
Extended Data Figure 3. PCoA showing that separation of NPC and HC groups corresponds to increased relative abundance of three Streptococcus species, identified as significant split nodes
Extended Data Figure 4. Large cohort data validated that the relative abundance of Streptococcus was increased in the oral cavity of patients with NPC
